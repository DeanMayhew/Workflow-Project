# Workflow Project

![Workflow design](/design/HomePage.png)

**Rough concept:**
The project will be a WebApp, as the primary use is for work in which the laptop is the preferred media.
The porpuse of this project is to help the user with organiszing and structuring the tasks for his/her (daily) work at the company.
There will be different workflows to choose from. Every workflow will have different steps which will either just be text/steps or input fields which can be filled out.

**MVP:**
The user wants to have a checklist in which he/she can fill in the task which has to be done.
The checklist starts with one point but an empty one will be added after the one before has been filled out.
Each point in the checklist should be numerated to symbolize the priority and order in which the tasks will be done. Also the single checkpoints will be able to drag and drop around to rearange the priority/order of the tasks.
Every task on the checklist will have its own checkbox to complete/tick off the task if finished.
If (all?) tasks are finished, there will be a feedback like a tick off.

**Fine concept(MVP):**
The Project will be one page. This page contains a checklist with a headline above it.
As a user I want to click into the first point of the checklist and enter some task to do. This data will be safed and displayed.
If the user finished the first task, so if he goes on blur with the first point, then a second, empty point appears. To this the same behaviour applies.
The user can have up to 15 task in the checklist.
Every point of the task list will have a number which indicates the priority, the order in which the tasks will be done.
The Workflow of the user will be to add all his tasks and afterwards decide in which priority they will be done. 
For this the user wants to be able to drag and drop single tasks around and adjust the order of the tasks. With this also the tasks number, which indicates the priority, will change accordingly.
Every point of the task list has some kind of checkbox in which the task can be set to the state of done and a continious feedback will be shown.
At the bottom of the task list is a counter of how many tasks are in the list and how much of them are set to done.
If all of the tasks are done there will be a overall feedback to indicate, that all tasks for the day are finsihed.
