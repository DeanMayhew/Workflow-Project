# Workflow Project

**Rough concept:**
The project will be a WebApp, as the primary use is for work in which the laptop is the preferred media.
The porpuse of this project is to help the user with organiszing and structuring the tasks for his/her (daily) work at the company.
There will be different workflows to choose from. Every workflow will have different steps which will either just be text/steps or input fields which can be filled out.

**MVP:**
The user wants to have a checklist in which he/she can fill in the task which has to be done.
The checklist starts with one point but an empty one will be added after the one before has been filled out.
Every task on the checklist will have its own checkbox to complete/tick off the task if finished.
If (all?) tasks are finished, there will be a feedback like a tick off.
